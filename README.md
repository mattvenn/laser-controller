# Epilog 32 ex usage & control system

Neither Epilog or Coherent were willing to share the DSUB 25 pinout that controls the Coherent C Series laser model 1138402-AA.

Board that breaks connects straight through 2 x DSUB 25 was made and after finding system ground, all pins were tested with laser on and off:
